Even though Dr. Suess’s books are mostly meant for a younger audience, they are still read by people of all ages. The Butter Battle Book is no different. Though targeted at children, it has a deeper meaning. That meaning does not only shed light on the environment it was written in, but it also connects to the world today. 
</p>

<p>
To summarize the book, it documents the tension between two groups: the Yooks and the Zooks. They are primarily the same, except for one petty difference. The Yooks prefer to butter bread butter-side up while Zook’s prefer to butter bread butter-side down. 
</p>

<p>
One of the Yooks, Grandfather Yook, was sent to patrol the wall. He had a very weak weapon, the Snick-Berry Switch. A Zook, VanItch, escalated the tension by bringing a stronger weapon, the slingshot. An arms race began. This escalation continued until both sides created an extremely destructive bomb, the Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo. The final page of the book left both sides at standstill, with both Grandpa York and VanItch ready to use the weapon. If one of them did drop the bomb, the other side surely would drop theirs. Both sides would have been annihilated.
</p>

<p>
This story connects deeply with the era it was created in. Amid the Soviets’ final years and the proudly anti-communist Reagan presidency, American and Soviet tensions were at an all-time high. Because of their differences, both of their ideologies were incompatible. The freedom-loving American’s could not coexist with the filthy, authoritarian Commies, and the hard-working Communists could not coexist with the fat-bellied, greedy Capitalists.
</p>

<p>
Because of this common hatred, both the US and the Soviet Union built up their defenses. During World War 2, the US developed the atomic bomb. However, they only had to use this technology twice, on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This newly developed weapon gave the US large amounts of power. Only a few years later, the Soviets developed their own bomb. Because the Soviet Union was now equally powerful to theUS, the US created more weapons. Then the Soviets did the same. This began a nuclear arms race that lasted almost half a century. By 1975, the Americans had nearly 27,000 nuclear weapons and the Soviets had 19,000 nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
This amount of nuclear weapons, if used all at once, would have obliterated the entire world. So if one country would attack the other, the other would retaliate, destroying both nations. This dynamic is called mutually assured destruction, or MAD. Both countries threatened nuclear war, but they never actually used any nukes against each other. Because the war never became “hot” (directly violent), this conflict was known as the Cold War.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Suess wrote The Butter Battle Book around the end of the cold war. Reagan, elected to the presidency in 1980, was radically anti-communist. Because of this, tension seemed to be at an all-time high. Though America was slowly denuclearizing, the Soviets were still building their nuclear stockpile. This large nuclear arsenal scared many Americans and Soviets of all-out destruction. One of these Americans was Theodor Geisel (Dr. Suess).
</p>

<p>
The Butter Battle Book was written as an allegory for the Cold War. The text communicates that an arms-race between two nations would be detrimental to both of them. The arms-race that Dr. Suess portrays is very similar to the Cold War. Weaponry in both texts advances to such a point that, if either side chose to use it, the world would surely be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The Yooks and the Zooks represent the capitalists and communists respectively. Since the book is written from the perspective of the Yooks, and because the book was predominantly written for a Western audience, many people connect the Yooks to the Americans. The Yooks and the Zooks represent the capitalists and communists because of their shared, strained relationships. Dr. Suess writes, “‘So you can’t trust a Zook who spreads bread underneath! Every Zook must be watched! He has kinks in his soul!” (Suess 7). Grandfather Zook is simply proclaiming his hatred for the Zooks. This hatred is a manifestation of that strain, the strain that also pervades the relationship between the American west and the Soviet east. The Yooks and the Zooks have two incompatible ideologies: spreading butter butter-side up and spreading butter butter-side down. The Americans’ and Soviets’ ideologies were also incompatible. These incompatible ideologies create that strain, and that strain created deeply entrenched hatred and fear. This hatred and fear are what shaped both the Yooks and Zooks destinies throughout the narrative. 
</p>

<p>
Also, this hatred and fear manifested itself in a physical form, a wall. The wall symbolizes an important aspect of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall. The wall in the story divides the Yooks and the Zooks just as the Berlin Wall divided the Western and Eastern sides of Berlin. After WWII, Germany was partitioned by the US, France, the UK, and the USSR. Berlin was also divided equally. The American, English, and French portion of Berlin became capitalist and westernized, while the Soviet portion became communist and authoritarian. The Berlin Wall ran between both sides, dividing them. The Berlin wall did not only separate land, but it separated people. This created a “us vs. them” mentality. The wall in The Butter Battle Book does the exact same thing. “‘As you know, on this side of the Wall we are Yooks. On the far side of the Wall live the Zooks” (Suess 4). Grandfather Yook bluntly stated that Yooks live on one side of the wall while Yooks live on the other. He simply states that here is us and over there is them. Just like the Americans and Communists, the Yooks and the Zooks cannot see themselves as even somewhat alike. In the story, the wall physically represents their intense differences just as in real life the Berlin Wall represents the capitalists’ and communists’ intense differences.
</p>

<p>
Grandfather Yook and VanItch both symbolize the militaries of the Americans and Soviets. In the book, Grandfather Yook and VanItch both used many weapons. They constantly tried to become more powerful than each other by creating new, more powerful weapons. Dr. Suess writes, “‘Slingshots, my boy, are not modern enough. ‘All we need is some newfangled kind of gun.” (Suess 18-19). This continuous upgrading created an arms-race very similar to the Cold War. Both, empowered by the hatred for each other’s beliefs, they created the most powerful weaponry imaginable.
</p>

<p>
The final weapon that both the Yooks and the Zooks created was the Bitsy Big-boy Boomeroo, which symbolizes nuclear weapons. Both weapons are known to be extremely destructive. Dr. Suess writes, “... And blow all those Zooks to Moo-Lacka-Moo, THEY’VE INVENTED THE BITSY BIG-BOY BOOMEROO!” (Suess 16). Suess emphasizes the immense power of the bomb. They are so powerful, in fact, that each side does not even need to use them. America and the Soviet Union never needed to use a nuclear weapon, they just needed to leverage their power. Still, this left both nations in a precarious spot. At any moment the US or the USSR could have attacked each other, either because of false alarm or a malfunction. The opposing nation would retaliate, causing MAD. If Grandpa Yook dropped the Bomb, surely VanItch would do so too. Both the Yooks and Zooks would have destroyed each other, just as the Americans and Soviets could have destroyed each other.
</p>

<p>
The way Dr. Suess finished the story was truly fascinating. He finished the story with Yooks and Zooks motionless upon the wall. Both stood there, ready to drop the bomb. Grandfather Yook nor VanItch took action yet, but both seem ready to do so. This image remains important today because of even contemporary superpowers, like the US, Russia, and China, still, own nuclear weapons. Today, if there was a malfunction in one of these nations’ nuclear detection systems, a nuclear war may break out. Only if we denuclearized as an entire planet we could surely avoid nuclear conflict. We are no different than the Yooks and Zooks. As long as countries are armed with nuclear weapons, just as the Yooks and Zooks stand upon that wall, the world remains tittering near obliteration.
</p>

<p>
Through The Butter Battle Book, Dr. Suess was trying to warn a younger generation about the dangers of a nuclear arms race. As a talented children’s author, he knew that writing about this topic directly would not be palatable for a younger audience. That is why he wrote the story as an allegory. He still conveyed his message without any complex geopolitics.
</p>

<p>
He also made this book further appealing bright illustrations and rhythmic catchy rhymes. The pictures catch both children’s and parent’s eyes. The nonsensical weapons seem like they were ripped straight out of a child’s imagination. The rhymes and the rhythm of the text also makes The Butter Battle Book more enjoyable to read. For a child that has a low attention span, the interesting rhymes keep him hooked on the story. Now the child, because of the rhymes and rhythm, is not just staring at the pictures, he is actively reading. These two tools are Dr. Suess’s greatest assets. It allows Dr. Suess to write children’s stories that children love while also conveying a more complex message.
</p>

<p>
Through his style, an entire generation is now cognizant of the precarious place the world sits. Now, with his help, we see both Grandpa Yook and VanItch, standing upon that wall, locked in that eternal struggle. The longer they stand, the further we dip towards nuclear midnight.
